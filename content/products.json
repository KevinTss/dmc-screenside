      "description_en": "With a characteristic orange colour and an unmistakable aromatic nose. Orval is a beer with an intense hop aroma that reveals a slight tartness and gains flavour when matured in the cellar for a few years. Its complex character comes from three separate fermentations and the local hops used to produce it. In the glass, it has an amber hue and a generous white head. Its aroma is recognised by its fresh hops and natural yeast. In the mouth, this beer stands out for its robust flavour.",
